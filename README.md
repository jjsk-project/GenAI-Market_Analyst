# GenAI-Market_Analyst
This project is still a work in progress. 
The project proposal is updated, please look at page 11 for the initial road map. 

At the current stage, I am unsure about the machine learning part of the project. Once the accuracy is higher than 70%, I will update more information about the machine learning algorithm and its hyperparameters.

This project is also my capstone project for the Master of Data Science.
Therefore, the ETA completion would be April. 
Please stay tuned for the coding part of this project.

Project 2: GenAI Market Analyst

Q1: What aspects of Generative AI are you most interested in?

I am interested in how generative AI can bridge between data and engineering. As a consultant in the data science and mechanical engineering field, I am excited to learn and explore various applications of GenAI. 

Q2:Have you experimented with or explored any Generative AI solutions?

I have utilised generative AI to summarize and prepare for industry learning materials and client deliverables. When starting a project in an industry that I am not familiar with, generative AI can help smooth the learning curve for the project and provide creative and diverse insights on the project. This could lead to more meaningful engagement and informative interactions.

Q3: What challenges are you looking to solve for you clients with Generative AI and are you actively engaged in conversations?

The purpose of this project is to solve the challenges that time-series machine learning (ML) algorithms are unable to react well to global and geopolitical events.

For example, the client is from the transport section, and crude oil price has a direct impact on their business. While the Russian-Ukraine war is affecting oil production and commodity prices. The fluctuating commodity price is affecting the budgeting and asset management strategy.  A promising asset life cycle and performance strategy rely on a stable and reliable way of predicting long-time price trends.

While traditional budgeting relies on banking analysts and time-series ML algorithms, the ML algorithm cannot automatically evaluate the impact of geopolitical incidents.

That is why this project would like to use GenAI to provide a reliable analysis input into the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) ML model.

This project can help in:
- Organizing asset management and financial model
- Providing better mid to long-term market direction.
- Granting the machine learning algorithm the ability to understand the impact of geopolitical incidents.

Other benefits:
For mining company:
- Production: If the estimated price is lower than the cost price. There is no point of production.
- Price Contact: Have a better understanding of lock-in price contracts with buyers. (refinery or manufacturer)

Client Engage side:
- **Provide better market trend:** Keep track in client's business context and market condition.
- **Asset management advisory:** Provide suggestion on when to stock and what to buy.
- **Proactive planning:** Plan proactively instead of waiting and react.

Other usage:
- **Community engagement:** Sentimental analytic and classification function can be used for social engineering. For example, prevent protest on building a wind farm or check out review on glass door.


Q4: What data or information have you been able to leverage with Generative AI?

The following resources are used.

    - OpenAI API with embedding function.
    - Crude oil datasets (Daily, 1988 to 2023)
    - Related news articles


Q5: Have you delved into any specific Generative AI frameworks or tools? (If applicable, include links to code repositories, videos, or other websites that demonstrate what you've been working on)

This project is still work in progress. Please have a look at the flow chart first. If the exemplar forum only accepts the completed project, please refer to my [Project 1: Industry News Summarization]
